# CrosshairPlus for CS:GO

**An improved crosshair with more information for Counter-Strike: Global Offensive.**

Currently displays health and ammo in your clip in close vicinity to the crosshair,
so you don't have to look at your screen's corners to know this information anymore.

This application uses the
[Game State Integration](https://developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/Counter-Strike:_Global_Offensive_Game_State_Integration)
API to communicate with the game. This means
**this application works in online games and is VAC-safe**.

**Note:** This application is still in early stages and isn't meant to be used in production.
